                                <h2>RISKS</h2>
                                <p>Cryptocurrency are primarily used by speculators, and are used relatively less on retail and commercial markets. The trading of cryptocurrency involves significant risk. Due to the trading throughout 24-hour a day without
                                    limits on the rise or fall in price, you may increase or lose value in your assets at any given moment. Cryptocurrency are probably susceptible to irrational (or rational) bubbles or loss of confidence, which could
                                    collapse demand relative to supply. The market makers and global government policies also may cause major fluctuations in their prices. Cryptocurrency transactions may be suspended or prohibited at any time due to the
                                    enactment or modification of national laws, regulations and regulatory documents. Digital assets trading is highly risky and therefore you should carefully assess whether your financial situation and tolerance for risk
                                    is suitable for buying, selling or trading cryptocurrency. Using internet-based trading systems also involves risks, including but not limited to failures in software, hardware or Internet links, etc. In view of the
                                    fact that we cannot control the reliability and availability of the Internet, we will not be responsible for any distortion, delay,link failure and even cryptocurrency lost. There may be additional risks that we have
                                    not foreseen or identified in our Terms of Use.
                                </p>

                                <h2>APPLICABLE LAW AND VENUE</h2>
                                <p>These Terms and your use of the Services will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Website registration country. You agree that any action at law pursued by you and arising out of or relating
                                    to these Terms not subject to arbitration (as set forth below) will be filed only in the local court where Bitexpro.com locates and you hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction
                                    of such court over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of these Terms.</p>
                                <h2>ARBITRATION</h2>
                                <p>You and we agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms or relating to the Services, except that you and we are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks other relief for the alleged unlawful
                                    use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents. ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT. You and we agree that you will notify each other of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when
                                    it arises, that you will attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration and that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator. You and we also agree that the local court where
                                    Bitexpro.com locates has exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals of an arbitration award and over any suit between the parties not subject to arbitration. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in by a
                                    private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person, if we are a party to the proceeding.</p>
                                <h2>SEPARABILITY </h2>
                                <p>If any provision of this Agreement is deemed to be unlawful, invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be deemed to be divisible and shall not affect the legal effect of any other provision </p>

                                <h2>INDEMNITY</h2>
                                <p>To the full extent permitted by applicable law, you hereby agree to indemnify Bitexpro, and its partners against any action, liability, cost, claim, loss, damage, proceeding or expense suffered or incurred if direct or
                                    not directly arising from your use of Bitexpro.com, your use of the Service, or from your violation of these Terms of Use.</p>

                                <h2>Risk Warning & Compliance Disclosures</h2>
                                <p>This Risk and Compliance Disclosure should be read in conjunction with the Terms of Use, KYC& AML Policy, and Privacy Policy. The trading of goods and products, real or virtual, as well as cryptocurrencies involves significant
                                    risk. Prices can and do fluctuate on any given day. Due to such price fluctuations, you may increase or lose value in your assets at any given moment. Any currency – virtual or not – may be subject to large swings in
                                    value and may even become worthless. There is an inherent risk that losses will occur as a result of buying, selling or trading anything on a market. Cryptocurrency trading also has special risks not generally shared
                                    with official currencies or goods or commodities in a market. Unlike most currencies, which are backed by governments or other legal entities, or by commodities such as gold or silver, cryptocurrency is a unique kind
                                    of “fiat” currency, backed by technology and trust. There is no central bank that can take corrective measure to protect the value of Bitcoins in a crisis or issue more currency. Instead, cryptocurrency is an as-yet
                                    autonomous and largely unregulated worldwide system of currency firms and individuals. Traders put their trust in a digital, decentralized and partially anonymous system that relies on peer-to-peer networking and cryptography
                                    to maintain its integrity.</p>
                                <p>Cryptocurrency trading is probably susceptible to irrational (or rational) bubbles or loss of confidence, which could collapse demand relative to supply. For example, confidence might collapse in cryptocurrency because
                                    of unexpected changes imposed by the software developers or others, a government crackdown, the creation of superior competing alternative currencies, or a deflationary or inflationary spiral. Confidence might also
                                    collapse because of technical problems: if the anonymity of the system is compromised, if money is lost or stolen, or if hackers or governments are able to prevent any transactions from settling. There may be additional
                                    risks that we have not foreseen or identified in our Terms of Use. You should carefully assess whether your financial situation and tolerance for risk is suitable for buying, selling or trading Bitcoins. Your top-up
                                    and withdraw in fiat will be processed via qualified 3rd party dealers, not our bank. Bitexpro is an entity incorporated in Republic of Seychelles, which has certain benefits. However, we cannot and do not want customers
                                    in jurisdictions that have banned activities involving cryptocurrencies, required costly cross-jurisdictional regulations, or on international sanction lists. We simply don’t want to run afoul with various country’s
                                    regulations. While we may not welcome costly regulations, we respect regulations and comply with applicable regulations. As good corporate citizens, we may be asked for information from law enforcement authorities and
                                    will assist if permissible by law. What this means is that our platform only welcomes law abiding customers. We welcome the opportunity to earn your business, in return we require that you act legally and properly on
                                    our platform.</p>
